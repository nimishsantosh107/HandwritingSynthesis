Monitoring Hotspots in Distributed Computing.

# Problem Statement:
Now a days, most online services hosted in data centre servers demand uninterrupted 24x7 services. A hotspot is an overloaded condition of the physical machine (PM) where it does not have adequate resources to serve immediate demanded request. Hotspots are unfavourable situations which cause SLA violations in some scenarios. We learnt that hotspots in data centers are caused due to a lack of resources to satisfy the peak immediate requests from clients. The nature of resource utilization in data centers are totally dynamic in context and may lead to hotspots. During the occurrence of the hotspot, the downtime of physical servers increases drastically which degrade the performance level of PM and may lead to SLA violation. Frequent creation of hotspots in physical servers affect qoS of entire system. It is because additional cooling systems has to be provided to cool the overloaded machines. So, handling hotspots are very essential especially when the data centre is handling high available or online services.
